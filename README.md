# AI Agent Operating Instructions

This repository includes `AI_INSTRUCTIONS.md`, a specification that defines how an AI development assistant should behave when interacting with this codebase.

## Purpose

The instructions establish guidelines for:
- Safe and predictable AI-assisted development  
- Security-minded code interactions  
- Transparent, reversible, and human-reviewed changes  
- Consistent architectural and coding practices  

These rules ensure the AI operates as a **collaborative pair-programming assistant**, not an autonomous agent.

## How to Use

- Keep `AI_INSTRUCTIONS.md` **local and private**; it is not intended for public distribution.  
- Load or reference it when configuring an AI to work on this project.  
- Extend it with project-specific rules as the codebase evolves.

## Key Principles (High-Level)

- Human-in-the-loop at all times  
- No autonomous destructive actions  
- Strong respect for version control and security  
- Clear, consistent communication from the AI assistant  

## Status

- **Document:** `AI_INSTRUCTIONS.md`  
- **Role:** Governing behavior specification for AI assistants  
- **Review:** Updated as needed
